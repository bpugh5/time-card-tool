# time-card-tool

This project is meant to serve as a personal tool to quickly calculate clock out time based on:

* When the shift started
* How much time has been worked since then (in decimal format)
* The desired number of hours to work in the shift

Each of these details can be customized, or left to their default values.

Additionally, you may enter the number of hours (in decimal format) worked each day of the week into a comma delimited text box, as well as how many hours you need to get to, in order to determine how many hours (in decimal format) you still have left to work to reach that goal.
